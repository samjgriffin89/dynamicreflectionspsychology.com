						</div>
						<div class="faq-answer" id="customized-2">
					        <p>You have lives! Often there are obstacles to finding a consistent weekly time that works for three people. This way we can identify just two days (preferably consecutive but not required) that works for all of us. </p>
						</div>

						<div class="faq-question" data-target="customized-3">

					<div class="faq-item">
						<div class="faq-question" data-target="attention-2">
							<strong>Uninterrupted time to explore topics with no time limits.</strong>
							<span class="faq-arrow">&gt;</span>
						</div>

						</div>
					</div>

					<div class="faq-item">
						<div class="faq-question" data-target="attention-3">
							<strong>No week-long interruptions in the process that may impede progress.</strong>
							<span class="faq-arrow">&gt;</span>
						</div>
						<div class="faq-answer" id="attention-3">
					        <p>Often new conflicts arise and old patterns reemerge in-between sessions, but we will be able to focus on practicing new skills and interrupting those old patterns so that your brain can retain the new way of interacting more easily.</p>
						</div>
					</div>

					<div class="faq-item">
						<div class="faq-question" data-target="attention-4">
							<strong>Enough time to receive a lot of education, coaching, and practice.</strong>
							<span class="faq-arrow">&gt;</span>
						</div>
						<div class="faq-answer" id="attention-4">

						</div>
					</div>

					<h2 class="tangerine-text section-title">Psychoeducation about the brain and relationship patterns</h2>
					
					<div class="faq-item">
						<div class="faq-question" data-target="psychoeducation-1">
							<strong>Understand how your brain functions to protect you, but inadvertently may contribute to dysregulated emotions and conflict.</strong>
							<span class="faq-arrow">&gt;</span>
						</div>
						<div class="faq-answer" id="psychoeducation-1">

							<span class="faq-arrow">&gt;</span>
						</div>
						<div class="faq-answer" id="coaching-1">
					        <p>No one can think straight, let alone speak calmly and rationally, when they are upset. Learn and practice taking the time you need to regulate/calm your body in order to resume the conversation.</p>
					        <p>Your partner can also learn to help support you through difficult emotions and interact in new ways that are less likely to activate them.</p>
						</div>
					</div>

					<div class="faq-item">
						<div class="faq-question" data-target="coaching-2">
							<strong>Therapist can observe, interrupt, and encourage new communication skills as negative habits emerge that typically lead to conflict.</strong>
							<span class="faq-arrow">&gt;</span>
						</div>
						<div class="faq-answer" id="coaching-2">
					        <p>Emotions are a normal and necessary part of the human experience and there is no stopping them. I can help you to recognize what they are and how they impact your interactions while adjusting your reactions and how you communicate when they emerge.</p>

						<div class="faq-answer" id="habits-1">
					        <p>The intensive is designed for your brain to get many chances to practice new skills so that it can more easily access these when you return home.</p>
					        <p>You will have much more time to develop the skills and practice them than in a traditional couple's therapy setting.</p>

							<span class="faq-arrow">&gt;</span>
						</div>
						<div class="faq-answer" id="challenges-1">
					        <p>Understanding why things are a big deal to you, how you learned to react in certain ways, what you do to cope with big feelings, and how these impact your partner can take some time to unpack. We will have this time!</p>
						</div>
					</div>

					<div class="faq-item">
						<div class="faq-question" data-target="challenges-2">

							<span class="faq-arrow">&gt;</span>
						</div>
						<div class="faq-answer" id="challenges-2">
					        <p>Everyone wants to feel heard but we often never learn to truely listen. I can teach you how to stay grounded rather than reactive while listening to your partner.</p>

							<span class="faq-arrow">&gt;</span>
						</div>
						<div class="faq-answer" id="resources-1">
					        <p>Relationships don't typically come with a handbook.</p>

						</div>
						<div class="faq-answer" id="followup-2">
					        <p>The skills you will take home are wonderful and can be used for different topics forever! However, sometimes couples still want more support and that is completely fine!</p>

						</div>
						<div class="faq-answer" id="savings-1">
					        <p>Since traditional therapy is broken up into 1-2 hour sessions meeting once a week or less, and life happens in between, it can understandably take a long time to learn and practice new skills.</p>
						</div>
					</div>

					<div class="faq-item">
						<div class="faq-question" data-target="savings-2">
							<strong>You will leave with the skills necessary to navigate issues in your relationship on your own at home, even if we arent able to address all of them in two days.</strong>

						</div>
						<div class="faq-answer" id="savings-2">
					        <p>The intensive is designed to help you adjust the way you interact with your partner. These skills can also be applied to other relationships (e.g. with kids, friends, family members, coworkers).</p>
