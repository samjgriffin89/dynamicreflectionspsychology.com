		<h3>Why Try Psychotherapy?</h3>
		<p>
			If you are considering going to therapy, you are likely recognizing distress in your life, want to learn more about yourself, and/or are ready to invest in a long-lasting healing process. Your options include individual therapy to address the root of the issue, or couples therapy to address concerns within a relationship.
