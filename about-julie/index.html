			<p>
				Dr. Griffin earned her Doctorate in Clinical Psychology from the University of Denver in 2017 and opened Dynamic Reflections Psychology after earning her license in 2019. She has had eight years of clinical experience working with various populations,  and is certified as a family mediator, discernment couples counselor, and canine assisted therapist. Dr. Griffin uses an integrative psychodynamic approach to psychotherapy in order to help clients better understand themselves within their life context. She specializes in healing relationships, both through couples counseling and individual therapy. People form relationships with everything in their lives, including their own thoughts, feelings, and actions. These internal experiences tend to impact their sense of self and influence patterns of interaction with others. I am here to help you to recognize, understand, develop compassion for, and modify these interactions.

			<h3 class="blue-text">Mission statement</h3>

			<p>
				I enjoy working with people who would like to understand themselves in a deeper way, heal wounds created by past or present relationships, and develop assertive communication to get their needs met more effectively.
			</p>

			<h3 class="tangerine-text">Vision</h3>

			<p>
				In a busy, quick-fix culture often fixated on perfection, I seek to provide clients with a safe space to slow down, reflect on personal beliefs / values, and work through all the emotions that make us human. Engaging in this process can provide short-term symptom relief while delving into longer-term healing. I can support clients in recognizing repeated behavioral patterns that were once protective, yet are no longer helping them in reaching their goals. I offer to work with clients to understand themselves better and develop self-compassion to heal shameful wounds from past experiences or mistakes. Clients can learn to identify and respond to emotional reactions in a mindful way, and feel more empowered to develop new ways of interacting with the world. I hope to address each of these factors by developing a trusting therapeutic relationship through which clients can safely explore specific dynamics within themselves and in their personal relationships.
			</p>

			<p>
				I choose to work from a psychodynamic orientation in order to create enduring, long lasting therapeutic effects. While a quick-fix symptom relief strategy can be beneficial, my preference is to foster long term growth. If you choose to work with me, I hope to empower you to:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>understand how you came to be who you are today through lifelong intra/interpersonal dynamics</li>
				<li>generate self-compassionate mindset to help you heal</li>
				<li>ground yourself in personal values to guide your decisions</li>
				<li>develop healthier relationships through modifying communication skills</li>
				<li>reduce overall suffering and allow for increased involvement with learning, creativity, gratitude, and joy.</li>
			</ul>
