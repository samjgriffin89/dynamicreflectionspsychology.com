		<h3>Anger Management</h3>
		<p>
			Anger is a very helpful emotion to have. We need it to advocate for our needs and recognize when others are violating our dignity. However, it can sometimes feel like an over-reaction when past injuries go unresolved and small triggers lead to excessive anger. Learn to recognize what is fueling your anger, develop coping resources, increase self-understanding, and respond to others in more constructive ways.

		<h3>Anxiety</h3>

			An intense, excessive, and persistent worry and fear about everyday situations, often accompanied by a fast heart rate, rapid breathing, sweating, and feeling tired. There are several types, including generalized anxiety, social anxiety, panic attacks, phobias, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). Learn to recognize and regulate your symptoms so you can return to focusing on life goals.

		<h3>Assertive Communication</h3>
		<p>
			People often learn that in order to get their needs met they have to work very hard act in certain ‚Äúacceptable‚Äù ways in the eyes of others. Alternatively, some are provided with everything automatically and do not get opportunities to practice identifying and asking for what they need. Learn what your needs are and how to get them met effectively, without disrespecting yourself or others.

		<h3>Attachment Disruptions</h3>
		<p>
			Attachment represents how we connect on an emotional level with others. It is strongly influenced by early caregiver interactions and other significant relationships. There are many ways we learn to feel safe or threatened in the company of others, and we typically respond by behaving in ways to increase the chances of feeling acceptable in their eyes. Learn how to navigate closeness with others when you have previously felt safer maintaining distance to protect against getting hurt.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div class="cta blue-cta col-md-10 col-lg-4 col-xl-4">
		<h3>Attachment Trauma</h3>
		<p>
			Sometimes early caregivers are particularly cruel, judgmental, or neglectful of children because they suffered attachment trauma themselves or have limited capacity for vulnerability and compassion. You can engage in a corrective emotional experience in therapy to help process and heal from early childhood disruptions in caregiver relationships and develop safety and trust in current or future relationships.
		</p>

		<h3>Control</h3>
		<p>
			Do you get upset if things don‚Äôt go just the way you want? Has anyone in your life complained that you are too controlling? Your anxiety is actually worsened through an excessive need for predictability and power.

		<h3>Coping Skills</h3>
		<p>
			When emotions are at their most powerful it can be hard to remember what it was like to feel safe and connected to others. Our instinctual fight-flight-freeze system is designed to keep us safe and learn to steer clear of threatening situations. In this modern day, triggers of danger are often socially oriented, and paired with judgments about our expressed emotions learned while growing up. We often need extra support in learning how to regulate our bodies and reconnect with personal values, desires, and logical reasoning that can help us make healthier decisions.

		<h3>Procrastination </h3>
		<p>
